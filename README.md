# 🖼️ Image Enhancement Using Spatial Domain Techniques

This project demonstrates various **image enhancement techniques** using spatial domain operations in Python, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV and Matplotlib. It was originally developed in Google Colab and showcases practical applications for contrast improvement, noise reduction, sharpening, and edge detection.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **Histogram Equalization**  
  Enhance image contrast by redistributing pixel intensity.

- **Logarithmic Transformation**  
  Expands dark pixel values and compresses bright ones to improve visibility.

- **Smoothing Techniques**  
  - Mean Blur  
  - Gaussian Blur  
  - Median Blur  
  - Bilateral Filter

- **Contrast Stretching**  
  Normalizes the pixel intensity range for better visual quality.

- **Sharpening**  
  Emphasizes edges using convolution filters.

- **Gamma Correction (Power-Law Transformation)**  
  Adjusts brightness based on a gamma curve.

- **Morphological Operations**  
  - Opening (Erosion followed by Dilation)  
  - Closing (Dilation followed by Erosion)

- **Edge Detection Algorithms**  
  - Sobel  
  - Canny  
  - Laplacian  
  - Prewitt
